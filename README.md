# Crop Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict crop yields using machine learning techniques based on historical data, weather information, soil data, and other relevant parameters. The predictions generated by the models can be valuable for farmers, agricultural policymakers, and investors to make informed decisions and plan agricultural activities efficiently.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

1. `data`: This directory contains the datasets used for training and validation. The data should be in CSV format and split into appropriate training and validation sets.

2. `notebooks`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The notebooks are named in a logical order to indicate the flow of the project.

3. `models`: This directory contains the trained machine learning models serialized in a format that allows easy loading for predictions.

4. `scripts`: This directory contains any necessary Python scripts for preprocessing, data transformation, and other tasks that are used in the notebooks.

5. `requirements.txt`: This file lists all the required Python packages and their versions to set up the project environment.

## Data Collection

The data used in this project includes historical crop yield data, weather data (temperature, precipitation, humidity, etc.), soil data (nutrient levels, pH, moisture content), crop management practices, and any other relevant factors. The data should be collected from reliable sources and appropriately formatted for analysis.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv crop_prediction_env
source crop_prediction_env/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Place the relevant datasets in the `data` directory.

5. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory in the given order to perform data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

6. The trained models will be saved in the `models` directory.

## Model Evaluation

The models' performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The evaluation results can be found in the respective notebooks.

## Deployment

To deploy the trained model for crop yield prediction in a real-world setting, use the serialized model files generated in the `models` directory. Implement the necessary code to load the model and make predictions based on new, unseen data.
